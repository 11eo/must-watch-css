# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Search open and closed PR's to avoid duplicate suggestions.
* Specify why the presentation is a must-watch, e.g., what did you learn from it, how will this be of value to developers?
* Use the following format: <pre>`[**Talk Title**](link): Presenter, Event` &#96;Duration&#96;</pre>
    - For multiple presenters use a serial comma as appropriate, e.g., Marcia, Jan, and Cindy.
    - Don't use an ampersand with the serial comma, e.g., Greg, Peter, & Bobby.
    - If the presentation is a screencast use (screencast) in lieu of Event.
    - The duration should be surrounded by backticks, e.g., &#96;28:30&#96;.
* Use the correct title of the presentation (don't rely on the title uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, et al.).
* Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com). 
* Add suggestions to the end of the appropriate year block; if re-ordering is needed the repository owner will make a final determination.

Thank you for your suggestions!
