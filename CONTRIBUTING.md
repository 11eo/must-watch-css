# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull requests adhere to the following guidelines:

* Search open and closed PR's to avoid duplicate suggestions.
* Specify why the presentation is a must-watch, e.g., what did you learn from it, what can others learn from it.
* Use the following format: `[**Talk Title**](link): Presenter, Event Duration`
    - For multiple presenters use a serial comma as appropriate, e.g., Marcia, Jan, and Cindy.
    - Don't use an ampersand with the serial comma, e.g., Greg, Peter, & Bobby.
    - The duration should be surrounded by backticks (`).
* Use the correct title of the presentation(don't rely on the title uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, et al.).
* Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com). 
* Add suggestions to the end of the appropriate year block; if re-order is needed Matt Smith will make a final determination.

Thank you for your suggestions!
